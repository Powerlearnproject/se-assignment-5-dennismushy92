vs code UI adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened; The mains components of vs code includes; Activity bar, Side bar, Editor Group and Status Bar; THE PURPOSE OF ACTIVITY BAR INCLUDES; quick access to different views and tools within VS Code. Each icon in the Activity Bar represents a different activity, such as: Explorer: For browsing and managing files and folders; Search: For finding text within your project; Source Control: For version control operations (e.g., Git); Run and Debug: For managing and running debugging sessions; Extensions: For searching, installing, and managing VS Code extensions; THE PURPOSE OF SIDE BAR INCLUDES; displays various views that correspond to the active item in the Activity Bar. It serves as the main panel for navigating and managing your workspace; EDITOR GROUP; This is where the actual code editing happens. The Editor Group can contain one or more editor tabs. Each tab represents an open file or document. Features include: Split Views: You can split the editor into multiple groups to view and edit files side by side; Tab Management: Tabs can be moved, rearranged, or closed; Syntax Highlighting: Provides color-coded syntax for various programming languages; THE STATUS BAR; It provides information about the current state of the editor and your project. It displays details such as: Current Branch: Shows the active Git branch; Current File Encoding: Displays the file's encoding format; Line and Column Numbers: Indicates the cursor position in the current file; Language Mode: Shows the language or file type being edited; Error and Warning Counts: Displays the number of errors and warnings in the current file.
The Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful feature that allows you to access and execute a wide range of commands quickly.

Extensions in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) play a crucial role in enhancing the functionality of the editor. They enable users to customize and extend VS Code’s capabilities to suit specific needs and workflows. Extensions can add support for new languages, provide debugging tools, integrate with version control systems, and much more; To find the extensions you can go to the Extension View: Within VS Code, click on the Extensions view icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window; https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gKgSZ1NCy8o2uB6LUClvDOF7YmyOIJoohan9Uouk7I/edit?usp=sharing; To install the extension lick the Install button next to the extension; Examples of essential extension includes; Prettier; Live Server; Docker etc.
